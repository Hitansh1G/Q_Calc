/*
The package statement is necessary every time you create a new class in a Java project. It is Javaâ€™s way to tell the compiler the location of the class you are creating. So that is what the package statement does, but what is a "package" itself?

In simple terms, it is something that allows groups of related things in Java to exist together. The official definition is: "A package is a grouping of related types providing access protection and name space management."
